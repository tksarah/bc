Staker list / dApps
=============

https://agent.sun-t-sarah.work/cool.html

Displays a list of stakers for each dApp in dAppStaking.

- The number next to the dApp Name represents the total number of stakers.
- The data is formatted from on-chain data.
- By default, it is displayed in descending order of staking amount (switchable via the table header).
- dApps with many stakers may take some time to display.
- By selecting a dApp and pressing “Export CSV Data,” you can export a file that lists stakers and their stake amounts.
- The list of dApps itself is based on the data from **June 22, 2024**.
- Please be aware that there may be changes to specifications or delays in updating the list of dApps without prior notice.
